# Cometa Editor
Cometa is a simple text editor that works inside your terminal.


## Installation
Clone this repository and then, on the project folder, run the _make_ command on your terminal to build:
```
  make
```
It will produce a _editor_ inside that folder.
__Note__: the app is still on its early stage, you can only view text files and navigate through them.

## Usage
You can it like any other terminal-based text editor:
```shell
  ./editor file.txt
  ./editor
```
